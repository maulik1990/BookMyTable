# BookMyTable

Restaurants generally have a huge line outside during weekends and public holidays. Also the Manager 

has to continuously sync with the floor manager inside to understand the availability of table and this is 

currently done manually. This creates a lot of tension for the restaurant manager as well as a lot of time 

of the diner is wasted. This app will help in addressing these pain points.

The app will have created a line both online (by customer directly) as well as offline (by manager for 

walk in customers). This line will be real time updated i.e. if there is someone checked in, the waiting 

time for all the next in line should reduce as well as the no. of people ahead of him should also reduce.
